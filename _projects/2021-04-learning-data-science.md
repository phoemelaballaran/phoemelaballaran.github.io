  As part of my participation in the Eskwelabs Data Science bootcamp, I worked with a group on a data-for-good capstone project. Our objective was to analyze Twitter data using machine learning to determine the sentiments and primary concerns of Metro Manila residents regarding COVID-19 vaccination. To address some of these concerns, we developed a Q&A bot. My contributions to the project included scraping the tweets, cleaning the data, creating the BERT version of the chatbot, and developing the project's webpage. As I worked on this project, I became more aware of the challenges that come with handling language data in the Philippine context. The country boasts a rich linguistic diversity, which posed some limitations to our natural language processing analysis. Nonetheless, this experience made me appreciate the fact that language is constantly evolving, and there will always be aspects of it that technology may struggle to capture.
